# scorecard

Dev team wants to track who did the most work each week for bragging rights. Using the GitHub API, create a maintainable API or interface that exposes a scorecard that shows the top contributors on a single GitHub repository in the past week. Assume the team uses GitHub flow and that the team only cares about pull request related events.

## Score guidelines:
- Pull Request: 12 points
- Pull Request Comment: 1 point
- Pull Request Review: 3 points
